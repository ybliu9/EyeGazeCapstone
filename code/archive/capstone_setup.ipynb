    "### Eye Gaze Base Code\n",
    "This code is meant to help you get started with your project and it adapted from examples contained here: https://github.com/esdalmaijer/PyGaze/tree/master/examples. Please note that this code requires the eye tracker, so do not try to run the code yet unless you want to comment out the tracker lines and play with the display. If you have any questions, or if anything doesn't seem to be working properly, please let me know.\n",

    "In this example, we loop through a set of images, each time asking the experimenter to look at the image. The length of each experiment depends on the experimenter. When the experimenter presses the space key, they will be given 5 additional seconds of looking at the image before transtioning to the next image. The experiment can also be designed such that the experimenter looks at the image for some fixed, predefiend period of time. We can discuss these design details together."
