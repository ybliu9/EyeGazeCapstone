# Table Extraction via Eye Gaze Tracking
## Overview
In this project, we design a system to automatically extract tables from a document by using eye gaze, and then evaluate this system relative to manual extraction with respect to both speed and accuracy. 

This is a Capstone Project for Columbia University in collaboration with JP Morgan AI Research Institude.

## Setup

For developer and user convienience, we use python virtual environments for dependencies. The virtual environments use python 3.7 and is under the folder "eyegaze".

To start with, download the entire *eyegaze* folder in: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1u7680FylFu24XL-wcUKhH9chFj1conM-?usp=sharing
into your working directory, and <b>cd to the directory</b>.

```
# install venv, please ignore if you already have installed
python3 install virtualenv

# activate
source ./eyegaze/bin/activate

# upon successful activation, your command-line should show something like:
# (eyegaze) xxx: yyy$ 
# now you can start working within the environments

# deactivate
deactivate
```
